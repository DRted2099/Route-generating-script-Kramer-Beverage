# Routing_MATLAB

The script can run only when the excel file posted is used. The values and the size of the table can be changed, but the name of the columns should not be changed if the cose is to run as it is. If the column names are changed the respective table variables need to be changed in the script

The current excel sheet does not contain any latituses and longitudes and need to be filled in by the user

The script uses Latitude and Longitude to calculate the distance between two places. But the in-built function used for this calculated the straight line distance and not the actual distance between places by road.

The origin co-ordinate has to be inputted in the script. Currntly it contains a dummy value (Line 98 of the MATLAB script.)
